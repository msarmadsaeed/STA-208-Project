# STA-208-Project

## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Atari games

This repo is based on RL implementation of Atari games using Gym library. We have to aims in this project: (1) comparing different networks and their performance on these games and (2) comparing the parformance of different function approximtors like KNN, Ridge Regression and Tree based learner.
